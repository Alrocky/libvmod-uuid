Varnish UUID Module
----------------------

:Author: Mitchell Broome, Geoff Simmons
:Date: 2018-04-02
:Version: trunk
:Manual section: 3

SYNOPSIS
========

import uuid;

DESCRIPTION
===========

UUID Varnish vmod used to generate a uuid, including versions 1, 3, 4
and 5 as specified in RFC 4122. See the RFC for details about the
various versions.


FUNCTIONS
=========

uuid
-----

Prototype
        ::

                uuid()
Return value
	STRING
Description
	Returns a uuid version 1 (based on MAC address and the current time)
UUID
        ::

                set req.http.X-Flow-ID = "cache-" + uuid.uuid();

uuid_v1
-------

Prototype
        ::

                uuid_v1()
Return value
	STRING
Description
	Returns a uuid version 1. The functions `uuid()` and `uuid_v1()`
        are aliases for one another.
Example
        ::

                set req.http.X-Flow-ID = "cache-" + uuid.uuid_v1();

uuid_v3
-------

Prototype
        ::

                uuid_v3(STRING namespace, STRING name)
Return value
	STRING
Description
	Returns a uuid version 3, based on an MD5 hash formed from
        `namespace` and `name`. The `namespace` argument MUST be
        one of the following:

* "nil" (for the "nil UUID")
* "ns:DNS" (for the domain name system)
* "ns:URL" (for the URL namespace)
* "ns:OID" (for the ISO object identifier namespace)
* "ns:X500" (for X.500 distinguished names)
* a valid 36-character representation of a UUID, i.e. a string of the form "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", where all of the x's are hex digits, with appropriate restrictions on UUID formats (cf. the RFC)

If these conditions are not met, then `uuid_v3()` fails; it returns
a null string (typically, the header specified in VCL will not be set),
and an error message is emitted to the Varnish log with the tag
`VCL_error`.

The `name` argument can be any string.

Example
        ::

              set req.http.X-DNS-ID = uuid.uuid_v3("ns:DNS", "www.widgets.com");
              set req.http.X-MyNS-ID = uuid.uuid_v3("6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8", "www.widgets.com");

uuid_v4
-------

Prototype
        ::

                uuid_v4()
Return value
	STRING
Description
	Returns a uuid version 4, based on random numbers.
Example
        ::

                set req.http.X-Rand-ID = uuid.uuid_v4();

uuid_v5
-------

Prototype
        ::

                uuid_v5(STRING namespace, STRING name)
Return value
	STRING
Description
	Returns a uuid version 5, based on a SHA1 hash formed from
        `namespace` and `name`. The same restrictions and failure
        conditions regarding the `namespace` argument hold as for
        `uuid_v3()` above. The `name` argument can be any string.
Example
        ::

              set req.http.X-DNS-ID = uuid.uuid_v5("ns:DNS", "www.widgets.com");
              set req.http.X-MyNS-ID = uuid.uuid_v5("6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8", "www.widgets.com");

DEPENDENCIES
============

Libvmod-uuid requires the OSSP uuid library to generate uuids.  It is
available at http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/ or possibly as a
prepackaged library (usually named uuid) from your linux distribution.

This version of the VMOD requires Varnish since version 6.0.0 or the
master branch. See the project source code repository for versions
compatible with a Varnish release.

INSTALLATION
============

See `INSTALL.rst <INSTALL.rst>`_ in the source repository.

HISTORY
=======

* Version 1.5: RPM compatible with Varnish 6.0.0

* Version 1.4: add RPM packaging

* Version 1.3: compatible with Varnish 5.0.0 through 5.2.

* Verison 1.2: compatible with Varnish since 5.0.0

* Version 1.1: requires Varnish 4.1, creates internal UUID objects
  only once during a client or backend context and re-uses them for
  subsequent calls.

* Version 1.0: Varnish 4 version, supporting all UUID variants
